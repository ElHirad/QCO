# Quantum Combinatorial Optimization

This package is designed to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems using quantum computing algorithms. In CO, the objective is to identify the most optimal object among a limited set of objects. This package uses quantum mechanics principles and algorithms to search through all possible combinations of variables simultaneously, which can lead to significant speedup over classical optimization methods.
